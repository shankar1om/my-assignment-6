B.E.M Naming rules for classes:

>The BEM stands for Block Element and Modifier.
>When working on a large-scale web development project, itâ€™s essential to have a consistent and organized approach 
for styling. and with the help of BEM naming convention we can achieve that goal.
>BEM uses block, element, and modifier names to construct CSS class names, separated by double underscores (__)
 and hyphens (-).
>It is based on the idea of breaking down a web page into smaller, reusable blocks of code. 
>syntax:
block__element--modifier

how i have given class name using BEM naming convention in task 3.2?

>in my task there is single block div, and p1 p2 p3 are the child of div.
>i have  given div a block class named box.
>then i have given p1 p2 p3 seperate element classes usin BEM naming convention syntax.
Eg; block__element
    p1 class name:  box__para1 
    p2 class name:  box__para2 
    p3 class name:  box__para3 

>for modifier class name we use syntax
block__element--modifier
in p3 i have  used modifier class: box__para3--colgrad (gives liner gradient)
.modifier class used to override existing property of perticular element with some special property.
