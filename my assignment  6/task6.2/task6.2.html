            India has made progress in the last eight years as it has now become the fifth largest economy from the 10th
            rank globally in 2014, and within the end of this decade, it will become the third largest economy in the
            world, he asserted.

            "Global economy is going to go through a period of uncertainty. Geo-political fragmentation, geo-economic
            inefficiencies, and reversal of globalisation, and all these factors are currently underway.

            "Whereas between 2003 and 2008, globalisation was in its heyday. Interest rates were low or were being
            lowered globally..now interest rates either are rising or going to remain at a high level. We are realistic
            about our growth prospect, which is still going to be one of the world's highest growth rates at 6.5 per
            cent in real terms and 11 per cent in nominal terms," the economist said.

            An India economic strategy cannot exist in isolation. It is part of the broader relationship between
            Australia and India and the stronger that broader relationship the better the prospects of an economic
            strategy.

            India should be seen not only as an economic partner but also as a geopolitical partner. Just as the
            structural complementarity of our two economies lies at the heart of the economic relationship, so also are
            we seeing a growing geopolitical complementarity between Australia and India.

            This chapter examines the basis and prospects of Australia's strategic partnership with India. It does not
            make recommendations since it is beyond the scope of this report. It is intended to locate the economic
            strategy within the broader context of the shared geopolitical interests of Australia and India. The views
            expressed in this chapter are mine alone and should not be seen in any way as reflecting an Australian
            Government perspective.

            India is today in the midst of a major geopolitical repositioning, as it discards its old non-aligned
            movement rhetoric, pursues a hard headed national interests based policy and builds stronger strategic ties
            with a wide range of countries including the United States and its allies in the region, especially Japan.


            The India-China relationship will have elements of both economic cooperation and strategic competition, not
            unlike the way in which those two elements thread their way through China's relationships with the United
            States, Japan and others.

            Out of the varied values of Indian culture, those based on spiritualism have contributed a lot —harnessing
            the spirit of the Indians throughout the ages. With the result, the spiritual-minded Indians have succeeded
            in maintaining their Indianness which could not have been possible otherwise. It has been also possible due
            to the fact that the Indian life is dominated by the temperament which is well marked with spiritualism.

            Consequent upon that, the Indians have developed various thoughts of philosophy and spiritualism and gave to
            the world maximum number of systems of spiritualism in the form of philosophical thoughts such as Nyaya,
            Vaisheshika, Yoga and Vedanta. The Vedas provide spiritual orientation to the Indians giving them the basics
            of spiritual and moral life. Hence, the Vedic rishis should be acclaimed as the earliest spiritual masters
            on earth as their mantras resound with the kernel of spiritualism, and the Indian nation as the cradle of
            spiritualism. In India, spiritualism is not an obsession of the human mind, rather, it is a heritage as well
            as a continuous tradition.

            For, right from the Vedic times, India has enjoyed a rich spiritual tradition. The Indian scriptures also
            throughout covering a gamut of every human emotion and aspiration have made a sublime contribution to Indian
            spiritualism. Due to which, India has always attained reverent place in the world. The evolution of Indian
            spiritualism can be traced back to the vedic age, which was spiritually coded and the same spirit was
            further nurtured by great spiritual thinkers like Yajnavalkya, Maitereyi, Gargi and Nachiketas.

            Thus, in this form, the Indian spiritualism be termed as a form of philosophy, darshana or sight, and the
            Upanishads be held as proper sources of Indian spiritualism. As, these representing the high Himalayas of
            Indian spiritualism determine the height of the country’s wisdom. As to the question what is spiritualism,
            the answer would be it is the inner quest; a pathway for reaching the higher truth in life; a composite
            thinking for enlightening the realities of life, for considering challenges of life, human values and their
            evaluation.
